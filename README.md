# ✍️ Text Area with Real-Time Character Counter

This project is a simple web application that allows users to type messages into a text area while tracking character usage in real-time. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, it provides live feedback to the user and prevents typing beyond the maximum character limit.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time character counting
- ✨ Displays how many characters are typed and how many remain
- ⛔ Prevents typing after the maximum character limit is reached (200 characters)
- ⚠️ Shows a warning message when the limit is hit

## 🔧 How It Works

- The text area has a limit of **200 characters**
- As the user types, the character count updates like: `120/200 characters`
- If the user exceeds 200 characters:
  - Extra characters are trimmed
  - A warning message is shown
  - Further input is blocked
